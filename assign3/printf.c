/* Convenience functions `hex_string` and `decimal_string` are provided
 * to you.  You should use the functions as-is, do not change the code!
 *
 * A key implementation detail to note is these functions declare
 * a buffer to hold the output string and return the address of buffer
 * to the caller. If that buffer memory were located on stack, it would be
 * incorrect to use pointer after function exit because local variables
 * are deallocated. To ensure the buffer memory is accessible after
 * the function exists, the declaration is qualified `static`. Memory
 * for a static variable is not stored on stack, but instead in the global data
 * section, which exists outside of any function call. Additionally static
 * makes it so there is a single copy of the variable, which is shared by all
 * calls to the function. Each time you call the function, it overwrites/reuses
 * the same variable/memory.
 *
 * Adding static qualifier to a variable declared inside a function is a
 * highly atypical practice and appropriate only in very specific situations.
 * You will likely never need to do this yourself.
 * Come talk to us if you want to know more!
