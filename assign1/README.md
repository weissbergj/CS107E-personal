/assign1/: make run for assignment (larson.s), make run_extension for extension (larson_extension.s)
/assign1/compiler/: make run for lightshow; compiler in compiler.c

I wrote a naive compiler in C that has several functions (pb_output(), pb_on(), and custom_delay()). Navigate to the folder assign1/compiler/ and then type make run to see a fun lightshow. Go to compiler.c to see my code. I left some TODOs for functions I plan to add and optimize. I hope that writing my own high-level programming language will help me accomplish the final project and future assignments faster.

The extension is in the larson_extension.s file and is assembled with the makefile_extension. Run make run_extension to assemble.
