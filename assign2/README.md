See the clock.c file that contains code to run a clock countdown. Any value up to 9959 can be initialized. Adjust the main function to countdown(your_integer_input) and then run make run. For the extension, you can adjust the countdown to any value you like via a rotary encoder. Then press the rotary button to activate. After the countdown, a buzzer will play until interrupted by another button. Adjust the main function to rotary() and run make run. I did not make a fancy output since my button broke, but the difficulty in writing this code was the rotary encoder, not the final output. Imagine the final output called a larson scanner if it suits you. See the pullup activation and read functions in the gpio.c file. Other useful files include test_gpio_timer.c and gpio.h in cs107e/include.
