 * Ascii character. For a typed key not associated with an Ascii character,

 * The returned struct includes the ps2 key that was pressed or
 * released and the keyboard modifiers in effect.
 *
 * `keyboard_read_event` does not return until it observes a key
 * event for a non-modifier key. Pressing or releasing a modifier
 * key changes the state of the modifiers for other key events
 * but does not produce its own key event. For example, if the user
 * presses Shift, press 'a', release Shift, and release 'a', this
 * comprises four key actions (four calls to `keyboard_read_sequence`)
 * but only two key events (press 'a' and release `a`). The key
 * event returned for press 'a' has the shift modifier on, the key event
 * returned for release 'a' has shift modifier off.
