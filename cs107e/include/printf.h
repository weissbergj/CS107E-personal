/*
 * The functions vnsprintf, snprintf, and printf construct a
 * formatted output from an input format string and arguments.
 * These functions support same conversion options in format
 * string, but differ slightly in how the function is called
 * or what it does with the output string, e.g., whether it is
 * sent to the UART peripheral (printf) or written into the
 * destination buffer (snprintf, vsnprintf).
 *
 * The supported format conversions are
 *   %c    single character
 *   %s    string
 *   %d    signed decimal integer (%ld long decimal)
 *   %x    unsigned hexadecimal integer (%lx long hex)
 *   %p    pointer
 *   %%    used to output a single percent character
 *
 * The %c %s %d %x formats also allow an optional field width,
 * such as %7s or %08x.
 *
 * The field width enforces a minimum number of characters for this
 * conversion. The output is left-padded with spaces up to the
 * field width. If the field width is specified with a leading zero,
 * padding uses '0' characters instead of spaces.
 *
 * This version of printf does not support the many fancy features of
 * the standard library printf (no justification, no precision, no octal,
 * no floating point, etc.). Format conversions other than the supported
 * list are considered invalid. The behavior of printf for an invalid
 * format is undefined.
