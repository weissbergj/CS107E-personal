## Project description
This is a naive implementation of a chess algorithm, using a minimax scoring function with alpha/beta pruning. Please see headers.txt for all functions. Use this to understand overview.txt, which describes how our program functions.

## Member contribution
A short description of the work performed by each member of the team.

## References
These two ideas inspired our project, although we adapted no code from either:
* https://github.com/ellenjxu/mango-chess
* https://www.chess.com/forum/view/chess-equipment/making-my-automatic-chessboard
The main algorithm was designed from scratch. There are no reference libraries or repositories, but there are countless examples on sites like Wikipedia of algorithms implemented (e.g., minimax, alpha/beta pruning). These require a simple Google search.
